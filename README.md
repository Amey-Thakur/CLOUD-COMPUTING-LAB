                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Cloud Computing Laboratory (CSL803) is a core laboratory subject in the Final Year (Semester VIII) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course provides hands-on experience with cloud platforms, virtualization technologies, and deployment of applications using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Cloud Computing:

- **Cloud Fundamentals**: Introduction to cloud computing, service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and deployment models.
- **Virtualization**: Virtual machines, hypervisors, and containerization concepts.
- **AWS Services**: EC2 instances, S3 storage, IAM, Lightsail, and Lambda.
- **Web Deployment**: Website hosting, static site deployment, and WordPress on cloud.
- **Serverless Computing**: Building chatbots and serverless applications using AWS Lex.
- **Security**: Identity and Access Management (IAM), user groups, and access policies.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference.**

As a computer engineer, understanding cloud computing is crucial for developing modern, scalable, and resilient applications. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental cloud concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Cloud Computing.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

### Acknowledgments

Grateful acknowledgment to [**Mega Satish**](https://github.com/msatmod) for her exceptional collaboration on the Cloud Computing Mini Project - "Pizza Ordering Chatbot Using Amazon Lex". Her constant support, patience, and clarity throughout this journey made a real difference. Learning alongside her was transformative, not only because she explained concepts so clearly, but because she truly cared about understanding them together. Her thoughtful approach to teaching, openness to discussion, and steady encouragement turned challenges into meaningful learning moments. This work reflects the growth that came from learning side by side. Thank you, Mega, for everything you shared and taught along the way.

Grateful acknowledgment to the faculty members of the Department of Computer Engineering at Terna Engineering College for their guidance and instruction in Cloud Computing. Their expertise and support helped develop a strong understanding of cloud technologies and AWS services.

Special thanks to the mentors and peers whose encouragement, discussions, and support contributed meaningfully to this learning experience.
